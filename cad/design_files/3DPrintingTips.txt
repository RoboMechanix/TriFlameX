Design for 3D Printing Tips

- The minimum wall thickness for a sturdy wall is 3 mm

- Having two printed parts fit within another is all about clearance and tolerance.

- For a tight friction fit, go with 0.25mm of space.

- For two sliding parts, go with 0.50 mm of space.

- Tighten your belts! If you pluck your x and y belts it should be taut and
sound like a guitar string.

- Level your bed properly! Take a piece of paper and place it between the
nozzle and build plate. You should feel a slight amount of friction, and an
equal amount at each corner of your bed.

- Take your time and be patient, print a larger square and make sure the first
layer looks like it has a consistent thickness all the way around

- Print on the ground, or a sturdy work bench if possible. Vibrations can
cause quality loss in your parts

- After leveling your bed, make sure you have strong first layer adhesion with
the z offset feature. If you run your finger over the first layer it shouldnâ€™t move
off the build plate.
