        [ESP32 #1] — UART — [STM32]
        [ESP32 #2] — UART — [STM32]
        [ESP32 #3] — UART — [STM32]


Each ESP32:

    Reads ToF sensor data.

    Sends data to the Laptop over Wi-Fi.

    Receives commands from the Laptop and forwards them to STM32 via UART.

Laptop:

    Central brain.

    Receives data from ESPs (via MQTT).

    Sends command(s) back to ESPs to control STM32.
