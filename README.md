# TriFlameX ‚Äì Autonomous Swarm Fire-Fighting Robots 

**TriFlameX** is an STM32-based firmware project designed to enable seamless control of multiple cars (blue, red, black) in both autonomous and manual modes. The system leverages MQTT and ROS2 for communication, allowing real-time control, monitoring, and coordination of vehicles.

---

## Features

- Supports autonomous and manual driving modes
- MQTT-based communication for control commands and status updates
- Real-time coordination between multiple cars
- Integration with ROS2 for modular and scalable software architecture
- Robust connectivity monitoring and message handling
- Control message format with commands, direction, distance, and angle
- Smooth switching between manual and autonomous operation

## System Software Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](docs/images/CommsFlowChart.png)

### üß© Subsystems

- **STM32 (C, direct register)**: Controls motors, handles PD algorithms, receives commands via UART
- **ESP32 (Arduino/FreeRTOS)**: Reads LiDAR, calculates distance and angle, communicates via MQTT
- **Laptop (Python, ROS2)**: Acts as central MQTT broker and monitor, visualizes LiDAR scans using Processing

---
## üì° Communication

### üîÅ Inter-MCU
- **ESP32 ‚Üî STM32:** UART with custom packed binary protocol

### üåç Swarm Network
- **MQTT (over Wi-Fi)**: All ESP32 devices subscribe to:
  - `/car/<color>/distance`
  - `/car/<color>/control`
  - `/car/<color>/status`

### üß† Decision Logic
- Each car sends its distance to fire.
- Laptop selects the car with **lowest distance**.
- Only that car receives movement commands, others idle.

## üìê Custom LiDAR Sensor

![LiDAR Mount](assets/lidar_mount.png)

- **ToF VL53L0X** sensor mounted on a **NEMA 17 stepper**
- Performs **150¬∞ scans** in ~5 seconds
- Data is processed and visualized as a 2D point cloud in **Processing**
- STL file included: `/cad/lidar_mount.stl`

---

## üéØ Motion Control

### üìå PD Controllers

#### Distance Controller
```c
PWM = Kp_d * error_d + Kd_d * (error_d - prev_error_d);
```
#### Angle Controller
```c
Steering = Kp_a * angle_error + Kd_a * (angle_error - prev_error_a);
```
Saturation and dead zones implemented for stability

Forward/backward and turning control are combined

## Installation / Build & Run Instructions

Prerequisites

   - STM32 C toolchain (Keil, STM32CubeIDE, or arm-none-eabi)

   - ESP32 Arduino or FreeRTOS SDK
   - Python 3.10+ for MQTT broker and visualization
   - ROS2 (optional, for integration)
   - MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto or broker running on laptop)

Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoboMechanix/TriFlameX/
   cd TriFlameX
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   - ESP-IDF for ESP32 firmware development
   - ROS2 Humble (or the ROS2 version you use)
   - MQTT Broker (Mosquitto)

3. Flash the firmware to the ESP32:

   ```bash
   idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
   ```
4. Run the Python broker or ROS2 nodes on your host PC.

5. Start the MQTT visualizer.

6. Place fire object, watch the swarm coordinate.

## Usage

- **Manual Mode:** Control cars directly via MQTT messages with ROS2 topics.
- **Autonomous Mode:** Cars operate based on autonomous navigation algorithms implemented in Python.
- Switch modes dynamically by sending control commands.
